The main purpose of this project is to serve as a starting point for those who are struggling to put these above mentioned technologies to work together.

## How to run this project
1. Download **Apache Tomcat 8.5.x** from https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi ([Windows](https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.28/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.28.zip) or [Linux](https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.28/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.28.tar.gz)) and extract it to any folder on your computer
2. Open **Netbeans IDE**, go to "**Services**" window (Ctrl+5), right click on "**Servers**" node and select "**Add Server...**". Select "**Apache Tomcat or TomEE**" on "**Server**" field, change server name if you will and click "**Next**" button. On "**Server Location**", choose the folder where you extracted Tomcat on step 1 above.
3. Still on "**Services**" window, right-click on server you just created under "**Servers**" node and select "**Properties**". Under "**Platform**" tab, choose **JDK 1.8**" in "**Java Platform**" field and **uncheck** "**Use IDE Proxy Settings**" field, as shown below
